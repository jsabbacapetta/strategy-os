# Memory: Pattern Tracking System

**Last Updated:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

---

## Purpose of This File

This is your pattern memory — a living document that captures recurring themes, insights, and blind spots that show up across multiple reviews, years, or life stages.

**Why this matters:**

Most people repeat the same patterns without realizing it:
- Setting the same goals every year but never achieving them
- Experiencing the same energy drains but never addressing the root cause
- Avoiding the same decisions year after year
- Undervaluing the same strengths repeatedly

**This file surfaces those patterns so you can:**
- Amplify what's working
- Break what's not working
- Stop repeating the same mistakes
- Leverage your actual strengths instead of what you think your strengths should be

---

## How to Use This File

1. **Update it during annual reviews** — extract patterns from the past year and add them here
2. **Update it after pattern extraction** — if you upload past reviews or notes and run a pattern analysis, capture findings here
3. **Reference it during quarterly and weekly reviews** — your patterns inform your course corrections
4. **Don't delete old patterns** — archive them at the bottom if they're no longer relevant, but keep the history

## Repeated Strengths (Leverage These)

These are capabilities, qualities, or approaches that show up consistently across multiple years or contexts. You're good at these, they energize you, and you should do more of them.

### [STRENGTH 1]

**Where this shows up:**
(Annual reviews, feedback, accomplishments — where does this pattern appear?)

**Why it matters:**
(How does this serve your goals or vision?)

**How to leverage this more:**
(What would "doing more of this" look like?)

**First identified:** [DATE or YEAR]

**Last confirmed:** [DATE or YEAR]

---

### [STRENGTH 2]

**Where this shows up:**

**Why it matters:**

**How to leverage this more:**

**First identified:**

**Last confirmed:**

---

## Repeated Energy Drains (Eliminate or Restructure These)

These are activities, situations, people, or patterns that consistently deplete you. They show up in multiple reviews as sources of frustration, burnout, or resentment.

### [DRAIN 1]

**Where this shows up:**
(Which reviews, quarters, or years mention this?)

**Why it persists:**
(What keeps you from addressing this?)

**Structural fix:**
(What would eliminate or reduce this drain permanently?)

**First identified:** [DATE or YEAR]

**Last mentioned:** [DATE or YEAR]

**Status:** [Not addressed / In progress / Resolved]

---

### [DRAIN 2]

**Where this shows up:**

**Why it persists:**

**Structural fix:**

**First identified:**

**Last mentioned:**

**Status:**

---

## Repeated Goals (Not Achieved)

These are goals you've set multiple times but haven't achieved. This isn't failure — it's a signal. Either the goal doesn't actually matter to you, or there's a structural barrier you haven't addressed.

### [GOAL 1]

**How many times set:** [e.g., "3 years in a row"]

**Why you keep setting it:**
(What makes you think this matters?)

**Why it hasn't happened:**
(What's the real barrier — not the excuse, the real reason?)

**Decision:**
- [ ] Commit structurally (make a real plan and execute)
- [ ] Kill this goal (it doesn't actually matter)
- [ ] Reframe it (the goal is wrong, but the underlying intent is right)

**First set:** [YEAR]

**Last set:** [YEAR]

---

### [GOAL 2]

**How many times set:**

**Why you keep setting it:**

**Why it hasn't happened:**

**Decision:**

**First set:**

**Last set:**

---

## Repeated Decisions Avoided

These are conversations, choices, or actions you've been delaying for multiple quarters or years. Avoidance is expensive — it compounds.

### [DECISION 1]

**What you're avoiding:**
(Be specific. What conversation or choice are you delaying?)

**How long you've been avoiding it:**
[e.g., "2 years"]

**Why you're avoiding it:**
(Fear? Conflict? Uncertainty? Lack of clarity?)

**Cost of continued avoidance:**
(What is this costing you — energy, money, relationships, opportunities?)

**What would happen if you made the decision today?**

**First identified:** [DATE or YEAR]

**Status:** [Still avoiding / In progress / Resolved]

---

### [DECISION 2]

**What you're avoiding:**

**How long:**

**Why:**

**Cost:**

**What would happen if you made the decision today?**

**First identified:**

**Status:**

---

## Repeated Insights (Don't Forget These)

These are lessons or realizations that keep appearing in your reviews. You learn them, forget them, and relearn them. Capture them here so you stop repeating the cycle.

### [INSIGHT 1]

**The lesson:**
(What do you keep learning?)

**Where it appears:**
(Which reviews or years mention this?)

**Why you keep forgetting it:**

**How to internalize it permanently:**
(What practice, boundary, or reminder would lock this in?)

**First learned:** [YEAR]

**Last relearned:** [YEAR]

---

### [INSIGHT 2]

**The lesson:**

**Where it appears:**

**Why you keep forgetting it:**

**How to internalize it:**

**First learned:**

**Last relearned:**

## Patterns from Uploaded Documents

If you've uploaded past annual reviews, performance reviews, or personal notes and run a pattern extraction, capture the findings here.

### Pattern Extraction Summary

**Date analyzed:** [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Documents analyzed:**
(List files from `uploads/`)

**Key patterns found:**

**Repeated themes:**
-
-
-

**Blind spots:**
-
-

**Strengths undervalued:**
-
-

**Decisions repeatedly delayed:**
-
-

**Energy drains mentioned across multiple years:**
-
-

**Goals set but never achieved:**
-
-

**Insights:**

## Archive (Old Patterns No Longer Relevant)

When a pattern is resolved or no longer applies, move it here. Don't delete — you want the history.

### [ARCHIVED PATTERN 1]

**What it was:**

**Why it's archived:**

**When resolved:** [DATE]

## Instructions for Pattern Extraction (Optional)

If you have past annual reviews, performance reviews, or notes, you can use an AI assistant to extract patterns automatically.

**How to do this:**

1. Upload files to `uploads/past_annual_reviews/` or `uploads/notes/`
2. Ask your assistant (Claude, ChatGPT, etc.):

> "Read all files in the `uploads/` folder. Extract recurring patterns, themes, repeated goals, failures, strengths, and blind spots. Look for things I mention multiple times, goals I set but don't achieve, energy drains I mention repeatedly, and insights I keep relearning. Summarize findings and update `memory.md`."

3. Review the findings and integrate them into this file
4. Use these insights in your future reviews and course corrections

## How to Use This in Weekly and Quarterly Reviews

During weekly reviews, ask:
- "Am I repeating any patterns from `memory.md` this week?"
- "Am I avoiding any decisions I've been delaying for months or years?"
- "Am I leveraging my repeated strengths?"

During quarterly reviews, ask:
- "Which repeated drains am I still tolerating? What's the structural fix?"
- "Which repeated goals am I still setting but not achieving? Do I kill them or commit?"
- "What new patterns emerged this quarter that belong in `memory.md`?"

During annual reviews:
- **Update this file with new patterns from the past year**
- Review old patterns — are they resolved, still active, or no longer relevant?

## Final Reminder

**Patterns are data. Use them.**

If you notice something once, it's an event.

If you notice it three times, it's a pattern.

If you notice it three times and do nothing, it's a choice.

This file helps you see the patterns so you can make better choices.
