# Past Annual Reviews

Upload your past annual reviews, performance reviews, or year-end reflections here.

## What to Upload

- Previous annual reviews (from this system or elsewhere)
- Company performance reviews
- Self-assessments from past years
- Year-end reflection documents
- Goal-setting documents from previous years

## Why This Matters

Uploading past reviews allows you to extract patterns you can't see yourself:

- Goals you set every year but never achieve
- Strengths you consistently undervalue
- Energy drains you mention repeatedly but never address
- Decisions you've been avoiding for years
- Insights you keep learning and forgetting

## How to Use This

1. **Upload files here** (any format: PDF, Word, Markdown, text)
2. **Run pattern extraction** using an AI assistant:

```
Prompt: "Read all files in uploads/past_annual_reviews/. Extract recurring patterns: repeated goals, failures, strengths, blind spots, themes, and decisions I keep avoiding. Summarize findings and update memory.md."
```

3. **Review the extracted patterns** in `memory.md`
4. **Use these insights** in your quarterly and annual reviews

## File Naming Suggestions

- `2023-annual-review.pdf`
- `2024-year-end-reflection.md`
- `2022-performance-review.docx`

Keep it simple and chronological.

## Privacy Note

These files are private and local to your system. They're never uploaded anywhere unless you explicitly share them.
