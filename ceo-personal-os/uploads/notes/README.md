# Notes and Personal Documents

Upload any personal notes, reflections, or documents that might contain useful patterns or insights.

## What to Upload

- Personal journal entries
- Meeting notes from important decisions
- Reflections from coaching or therapy sessions
- Strategic planning documents
- Vision or mission statements from past years
- Letters to yourself
- Captured insights or lessons learned

## Why This Matters

Your notes often contain insights you've forgotten or patterns you didn't recognize at the time. Pattern extraction can surface:

- Recurring themes in your thinking
- Repeated frustrations or concerns
- Insights you captured but didn't act on
- Strategic ideas you abandoned without revisiting
- Personal values that show up consistently

## How to Use This

1. **Upload files here** (any format)
2. **Run pattern extraction** using an AI assistant:

```
Prompt: "Read all files in uploads/notes/. Look for recurring themes, repeated concerns, strategic insights, patterns in decision-making, and lessons I've captured. Extract key patterns and update memory.md."
```

3. **Review the findings** and integrate valuable insights into your system

## Tip

Don't overthink what to upload. If you have old notes, strategy docs, or reflections sitting around, just drop them here. Worst case, there's no useful pattern. Best case, you find a blind spot you've had for years.

## Privacy Note

These files are private and local. They stay on your machine unless you explicitly share them.
