# Past Year Reflection Interview

**A guided conversation with yourself about what actually happened this year.**

This is not a performance review. This is not a highlight reel for LinkedIn. This is an honest conversation about what the year felt like, what it cost, and what it taught you.

Run this interview once per year, ideally in late December or early January, before you set new goals. The point is to learn from what happened before you decide what happens next.

## Instructions

Read each question slowly. Sit with it. Answer honestly. No one else will read this unless you choose to share it.

If a question doesn't land, skip it. If a question unlocks something, keep writing.

---

## Part 1: The Highlights

Let's start with what went well.

### 1. Tell me about the last year — highlights first.

What are you most proud of from this past year?

(Include professional wins, personal growth, quiet victories that no one else saw.)

---

### 2. What surprised you in a good way?

What went better than expected?

What opportunity or outcome appeared that you didn't plan for?

---

### 3. What are you proud of that no one else sees?

What internal shift, private decision, or personal milestone mattered to you but didn't make headlines?

(Examples: "I stopped checking email at night." "I repaired a broken relationship with my co-founder." "I started therapy.")

---

### 4. What did you learn about yourself?

What strength did you discover or rediscover?

What capacity did you develop that you didn't have a year ago?

---

## Part 2: The Hard Parts

Now let's talk about what didn't work.

### 5. What drained you the most this year?

What activity, person, project, or pattern left you consistently depleted?

---

### 6. Where did you avoid hard decisions?

What conversation did you delay?

What choice did you rationalize away?

What problem did you know about in February but didn't address until October (or still haven't addressed)?

---

### 7. What failure or disappointment still stings?

What didn't work out the way you wanted?

What did you lose or let go of?

---

### 8. What would you not repeat under any circumstances?

If you could go back and undo one choice, pattern, or commitment, what would it be?

---

## Part 3: Energy and Alignment

Let's talk about how the year *felt*, not just what you accomplished.

### 9. On a scale of 1-10, how energized did you feel this year on average?

**Score: _____ / 10**

Why that number?

---

### 10. What gave you energy this year?

What activities, people, or projects made you feel more alive?

---

### 11. What drained your energy this year?

What consistently left you feeling depleted, resentful, or checked out?

---

### 12. Did your energy align with your output?

Look at your biggest accomplishments. How much energy did they cost?

- Were your wins expensive (high output, high energy cost)?
- Did you find any leverage (high output, low energy cost)?
- Did you waste energy on things that didn't matter (low output, high energy cost)?

---

## Part 4: Relationships and Connection

Success doesn't happen in isolation. Let's talk about the people.

### 13. Who were the most important people in your life this year?

Who supported you, challenged you, or showed up when it mattered?

---

### 14. What relationships improved this year?

What connection deepened, healed, or strengthened?

---

### 15. What relationships suffered this year?

Where did you lose connection, create distance, or let things decay?

---

### 16. What relationship do you regret not prioritizing?

Who did you neglect or take for granted?

---

## Part 5: Decisions and Trade-Offs

Every choice has a cost. Let's name the trade-offs.

### 17. What did you say yes to that you wish you hadn't?

What commitment, project, or partnership felt wrong from the start?

---

### 18. What did you say no to that you're glad you refused?

What opportunity did you turn down that would have been a mistake?

---

### 19. What did you sacrifice this year?

What did you give up (time, health, relationships, hobbies) in service of your goals?

Was it worth it?

---

### 20. What trade-off are you still making that doesn't feel sustainable?

What are you currently sacrificing that you can't keep sacrificing indefinitely?

---

## Part 6: Identity and Meaning

Beyond the metrics and milestones, who were you this year?

### 21. How would you describe yourself this year in three words?

(Not your job title. Not your company. You.)

**Three words:**
1.
2.
3.

---

### 22. Did you like who you were this year?

Not what you accomplished. Who you *were* in the process.

---

### 23. What do you stand for?

What principles or values did you defend this year, even when it was hard?

---

### 24. What do you stand against?

What did you refuse to tolerate or compromise on?

---

### 25. What gave you a sense of meaning this year?

What made you feel like your work and life mattered beyond quarterly goals?

---

## Part 7: The Repetition Test

This is the most important question.

### 26. If this year repeated exactly as it was — same wins, same struggles, same energy level, same trade-offs — ten times in a row, would you be satisfied?

**Yes or no:**

**Why:**

---

### 27. If not, what would need to change?

What would have to be different for you to answer "yes"?

1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

---

### 29. What pattern did you notice that you want to break?

(Repeated goals you never pursue, decisions you always avoid, energy drains you rationalize, etc.)

---

### 30. What pattern did you notice that you want to amplify?

(Strengths you undervalue, habits that serve you, high-leverage moves, etc.)

---

### 31. What are you carrying forward into next year?

What practices, relationships, priorities, or lessons are you bringing with you?

---

### 32. What are you leaving behind?

What are you consciously choosing not to bring into next year?

---

### 33. What's the one thing you want next year to be about?

If next year had a single theme or focus, what would it be?

---

## Closing Reflection

You've just completed a full year of your life. That year is now data. You can't change what happened, but you can extract the lessons and set clearer intent for what happens next.

**Final question:**

### 34. What would you tell yourself one year from now, when you're reflecting on the year ahead?

What advice, reminder, or encouragement would future-you want current-you to hear?
