# Identity and Values Interview

**A guided conversation about who you are and what you stand for.**

Most CEOs are so identified with their role that they've forgotten who they are underneath the title. This interview helps you rediscover (or define for the first time) your identity, values, and non-negotiables.

Run this interview:
- When you're feeling lost or disconnected from yourself
- During major transitions (new company, exit, life stage change)
- Once every 2-3 years as a grounding exercise

## Instructions

This is not about your LinkedIn profile. This is not about your founder story. This is about you — the person behind the role.

Answer honestly. There are no right answers. Only true ones.

---

## Part 1: Identity (Who You Are)

### 1. If your company disappeared tomorrow, who would you be?

(Not what you'd do next. Who you'd *be*.)

---

### 2. How do you introduce yourself when work isn't relevant?

(At a dinner party, on a plane, to a stranger who's never heard of your company.)

---

### 3. What are three words that describe you at your core?

(Not aspirational. Not your job. You.)

**Three words:**
1.
2.
3.

---

### 4. What do people who know you well say about you?

(Not what they say in public. What they say in private when they're describing who you really are.)

---

### 5. What parts of yourself do you hide?

What aspects of your personality, interests, or values do you downplay or suppress in professional settings?

---

### 6. Who were you before you became successful?

(Or before you became a founder, or before you took on your current role.)

What did you care about?

What made you come alive?

---

### 7. What do you miss about that version of yourself?

What qualities or priorities have you lost along the way?

---

## Part 2: Values (What You Stand For)

### 8. What do you believe that most people in your industry don't?

What contrarian view do you hold?

---

### 9. What principle would you defend even if it cost you money, status, or opportunity?

(This is your line in the sand.)

---

### 10. What do you refuse to compromise on, even under pressure?

(In business, relationships, or life.)

---

### 11. What makes you angry or frustrated?

(When you see injustice, inefficiency, or dysfunction, what triggers you?)

This often reveals what you value.

---

### 12. What do you admire in other people?

What qualities do you respect most?

(These are often your own values reflected back at you.)

---

### 13. What do you judge harshly in others?

(Be honest. What behavior do you find unacceptable?)

This also reveals your values — and sometimes your blind spots.

---

### 14. If you were mentoring a younger version of yourself, what values would you tell them to never compromise?

---

## Part 3: Strengths and Weaknesses

### 15. What are you genuinely world-class at?

(Not what your job requires. What you're *actually* exceptional at.)

---

### 16. What do you make look easy that's hard for others?

(This is often your hidden superpower.)

---

### 17. What weakness have you accepted about yourself?

(Not everything needs to be fixed. What have you made peace with?)

---

### 18. What weakness are you actively working on?

(What are you trying to improve or change?)

---

### 19. What do you pretend to be good at but secretly struggle with?

(Everyone has these. What's yours?)

---

## Part 4: Purpose and Meaning

### 20. What problem in the world do you genuinely care about solving?

(Not your company's mission. What do *you* care about?)

---

### 21. What legacy do you want to leave?

In 50 years, if someone tells a story about you, what do you want that story to be?

---

### 22. What would you do if money were no object?

(Not "travel the world." What *work* or contribution would you pursue?)

---

### 23. What are you building toward that's bigger than your current role?

(Career, life, impact — what's the long game?)

---

### 24. What gives you a sense of meaning?

What makes you feel like your life matters beyond metrics and milestones?

---

## Part 5: Non-Negotiables and Boundaries

### 25. What are your non-negotiable boundaries?

(Time, energy, values, relationships — what lines will you not cross?)

Examples:
- "I don't work weekends."
- "I don't do business with people I don't trust."
- "I don't sacrifice my health for growth."

**Your non-negotiables:**
-
-
-

---

### 26. What boundary did you recently set (or wish you had set)?

What did you finally say no to?

---

### 27. What boundary have you let slip that you need to restore?

Where have you been compromising on something important?

---

### 28. What are you tolerating that you shouldn't be?

(In your business, relationships, or life.)

What's the cost of continuing to tolerate it?

---

## Part 6: Relationships and Belonging

### 29. Who do you feel most yourself around?

(These are your people. Who are they?)

---

### 30. What kind of people drain you?

(Not specific names. What personality types, behaviors, or dynamics deplete you?)

---

### 31. What do you need from your closest relationships?

(Support, challenge, honesty, space — what do you actually need?)

---

### 32. What do you bring to your closest relationships?

(What value do you add? What do people count on you for?)

---

### 33. Do you feel like you belong somewhere?

(Community, group, network, place.)

If yes, where?

If no, what's missing?

---

## Part 7: Joy and Fulfillment

### 34. When do you feel most alive?

(What activity, environment, or state makes you feel fully present and energized?)

---

### 35. What do you do purely for the joy of it?

(No productivity goal. No outcome. Just because it makes you happy.)

---

### 36. What did you love doing as a kid that you've stopped doing?

(Play, creativity, exploration — what did you lose along the way?)

---

### 37. What would you do more of if you gave yourself permission?

(What's the thing you tell yourself you don't have time for but secretly wish you did?)

---

## Part 8: Self-Perception and Growth

### 38. What story do you tell yourself about who you are?

(This is your internal narrative. What do you believe about yourself?)

---

### 39. Is that story true, or is it just old?

(Some of our self-concepts are outdated. Are you still living in an old version of yourself?)

---

### 40. What belief about yourself would you like to let go of?

(What limiting belief is holding you back?)

---

### 41. Who are you becoming?

(Not who you were. Not who you are. Who you're growing into.)

---

## Part 9: Integration and Alignment

### 42. Do you feel aligned right now?

(Does your daily life reflect your values, identity, and priorities?)

**Yes / No / Partially**

**Why:**

---

### 43. Where is the biggest gap between who you are and how you're living?

(What misalignment is costing you the most?)

---

### 44. What would it take to close that gap?

(What would have to change?)

---

### 45. What's one decision you could make today that would bring you closer to alignment?

---

## Closing Reflection

You've just spent time thinking about who you are, what you stand for, and what matters most to you. This isn't abstract. This is your operating system.

**Final questions:**

### 46. After answering these questions, what's the most important thing you learned or remembered about yourself?

---

### 47. What's one change you want to make based on this reflection?

---
