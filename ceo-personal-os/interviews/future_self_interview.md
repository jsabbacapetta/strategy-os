# Future Self Interview

**A conversation with the person you're becoming.**

This is a visualization exercise grounded in specifics. You'll imagine yourself 3, 5, or 10 years from now and answer questions from that future perspective. The goal is to clarify what you're building toward and reverse-engineer the path to get there.

Run this interview:
- Once per year during annual planning
- When you're at a major crossroads or decision point
- When you've lost clarity on the long-term direction

---

## Instructions

Choose a time horizon: **3 years**, **5 years**, or **10 years** from now.

Write the date: **[MONTH, YEAR]**

Now imagine you've successfully navigated the path from where you are today to where you want to be. You're living the life you designed. Answer these questions from that future perspective, in present tense, as if it's already happened.

**Example:**
- Bad: "I hope to have a successful company."
- Good: "It's 2029. My company is doing $50M in revenue, I have a world-class team, and I only work four days a week."

Be specific. Be vivid. Make it real.
