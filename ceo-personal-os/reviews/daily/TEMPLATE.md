### Energy Level

On a scale of 1-10, how is your energy right now?

**Score: _____ / 10**

(1 = depleted, burned out; 10 = fully energized, sharp, alive)

**Why this score?**

(One sentence. What's affecting your energy today — sleep, stress, excitement, workload, health?)

### One Meaningful Win

What's one thing from today (or yesterday) that you're proud of or that mattered?

This doesn't have to be huge. It can be:
- A good conversation
- A decision you made
- A problem you solved
- A moment of clarity
- A personal milestone

**Win:**

### One Friction Point

What's one thing that's creating drag, frustration, or resistance right now?

This might be:
- A decision you're avoiding
- A person or situation draining you
- A process that's broken
- A commitment you regret
- A pattern you're repeating

**Friction:**

### One Thing to Let Go Of

What's one thing you need to stop thinking about, worrying about, or holding onto?

This might be:
- A mistake you're replaying
- A fear that's not useful
- A commitment you need to exit
- A problem that's not yours to solve
- A story you're telling yourself that's not true

**Letting go of:**

## How to Use This Template

1. **Copy this file** and rename it to today's date (e.g., `2026-01-15.md`)
2. **Answer the five prompts** — energy, win, friction, let go, tomorrow's priority
3. **Keep it short** — no more than 5 minutes
4. **Do it daily** — consistency matters more than depth
5. **Review weekly** — look back at the past 7 daily check-ins during your weekly review to spot patterns

---

## Why This Works

- **Energy tracking** helps you see patterns over time (when are you most energized? What drains you?)
- **Wins** remind you of progress when everything feels like chaos
- **Friction points** surface recurring problems before they become crises
- **Letting go** prevents mental clutter from accumulating
- **Single priority** cuts through noise and forces clarity

This is not a to-do list. This is a daily systems check.
