## How to Use This Template

1. **Copy this file** and rename it to the current quarter (e.g., `2026-Q1.md`)
2. **Block 1-2 hours** at the end of each quarter (late March, June, September, December)
3. **Review all weekly reviews** from the past 12-13 weeks before starting
4. **Update your Life Map** (`frameworks/life_map.md`) as part of this process
5. **Update `north_star.md`** based on your findings
6. **Adjust goals** in `goals/1_year.md` if needed
7. **Reference `memory.md`** to spot long-term patterns

---

## Why This Works

Quarterly reviews are your strategic checkpoint. They catch drift before it becomes disaster.

Without quarterly reviews:
- You chase goals that are no longer relevant
- You burn out without noticing the trend
- You miss strategic misalignments until they're crises
- You repeat the same patterns without learning

This 1-2 hour practice keeps you aligned, energized, and learning.

**Do this at the end of every quarter. It's non-negotiable.**
