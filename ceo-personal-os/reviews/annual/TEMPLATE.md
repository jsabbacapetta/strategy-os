## How to Use This Template

1. **Block 3-4 hours** in late December or early January
2. **Complete all prerequisite interviews and frameworks first**
3. **Review all quarterly reviews** from the past year before starting
4. **Be brutally honest** — this is for you, not for anyone else
5. **Use this to set next year's goals** — don't skip the goal-setting step
6. **Update all core documents** — North Star, Life Map, Vivid Vision, goals
7. **Save this review** and reference it quarterly next year

---

## Why This Works

An annual review without frameworks is just nostalgia.

A framework without honest reflection is just a template.

This process combines both: structured thinking + deep honesty = clarity.

You'll leave this review knowing:
- What the past year meant
- What patterns you're repeating
- What needs to change
- What next year is about

**Do this every year. It's the most important 3-4 hours you'll spend.**
