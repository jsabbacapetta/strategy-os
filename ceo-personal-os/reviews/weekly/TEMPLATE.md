## How to Use This Template

1. **Copy this file** and rename it to the current week (e.g., `2026-W03.md`)
2. **Block 20 minutes** every Friday afternoon or Sunday evening
3. **Review your daily check-ins** before starting this review
4. **Be honest** — this is for you, not for performance
5. **Use insights to adjust** — the point is to improve, not just reflect
6. **Track patterns over time** — after 4-8 weeks, you'll see themes that aren't visible week-to-week

---

## Why This Works

Daily check-ins give you data. Weekly reviews turn that data into insight.

Without weekly reviews, you drift. You stay busy but lose direction. You repeat the same mistakes without noticing.

This 20-minute practice is your early warning system. It helps you catch misalignment before it becomes a crisis and amplify what's working before you forget.

**Consistency beats intensity. Do this every week.**
