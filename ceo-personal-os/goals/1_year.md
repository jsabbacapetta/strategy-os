## Instructions

Your 1-year goals should be specific, meaningful, and aligned with your North Star priorities. These are not your entire to-do list. These are the 3-5 most important outcomes that would make this year a success.

**Good 1-year goals are:**
- Specific enough to measure
- Meaningful enough to energize you
- Aligned with your 3-year and 10-year vision
- Challenging but achievable
- Important enough that you'll actually prioritize them

**Update these goals:**
- Quarterly during your quarterly review
- Annually during your annual review
- Whenever your context fundamentally shifts (funding, exit, major life change)

## Integration with Other Documents

These 1-year goals should align with:

- **`north_star.md`** — your current top 3 priorities
- **`goals/3_year.md`** — your 3-year vision (1-year goals are milestones toward the 3-year vision)
- **`goals/10_year.md`** — your long-term direction
- **`frameworks/vivid_vision.md`** — your ideal life 3 years from now
- **`frameworks/life_map.md`** — balance across all six life domains

**If your 1-year goals don't connect to these, something's misaligned.**

---

## Common Pitfalls

**Too many goals:** If you have more than 5 goals, you don't have priorities — you have a to-do list.

**Too vague:** "Grow the business" is not a goal. "$5M ARR with healthy unit economics" is a goal.

**Not meaningful:** Don't set goals that sound good but don't actually energize you.

**Ignoring trade-offs:** Every goal has a cost. Are you willing to pay it?

**Forgetting to review:** Goals without quarterly check-ins become shelf-ware.

---

## End-of-Year Reflection

At the end of the year, answer these questions:

**Which goals did you achieve?**

**Which goals did you abandon or deprioritize?**

**Why the gap between what you planned and what you did?**

**What did you learn about goal-setting?**

(Save these reflections in your annual review.)

## Final Reminder

Goals are tools, not obligations. If a goal stops serving you, change it. If your context shifts, adjust. You own this system.

**The point is not to check boxes. The point is to move toward the life and business you actually want.**
