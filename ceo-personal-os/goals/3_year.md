## Instructions

Your 3-year goals define where you're headed, not just what you're doing next quarter. These are your strategic targets — ambitious enough to require real change, specific enough to guide decisions today.

**Good 3-year goals are:**
- Visionary but grounded in reality
- Specific enough to reverse-engineer into 1-year milestones
- Aligned with your 10-year vision
- Meaningful enough to sustain effort over time
- Clear enough that you'll know if you're on track

**Update these goals:**
- Annually during your annual review
- When your context fundamentally shifts (major funding, exit, life change, strategic pivot)

**Integrate with:**
- `frameworks/vivid_vision.md` — your emotionally vivid picture of life 3 years from now
- `goals/1_year.md` — your 1-year goals should be milestones toward these 3-year goals
- `goals/10_year.md` — your 3-year goals should align with your long-term direction

## Common Pitfalls

**Too ambitious:** 3 years is real time, but not infinite time. Don't plan for 10x if the path to get there doesn't exist.

**Too cautious:** 3 years is also enough time to make serious change. Don't just extrapolate current trends.

**Only professional goals:** If your 3-year plan is all business and no life, you're heading for burnout.

**Set and forget:** 3-year goals need annual check-ins. If you ignore them for 3 years, they're useless.

**Disconnected from 1-year goals:** Your 1-year goals should be clear steps toward your 3-year vision. If they're unrelated, something's wrong.

---

## Final Reminder

3-year goals are long enough to be transformational but short enough to feel real. This is where vision meets execution.

**Use your Vivid Vision framework to make this emotionally real.**

**Use your 1-year goals to make this actionable.**

**Use your annual reviews to stay on track.**

**The future doesn't just happen. You design it.**
