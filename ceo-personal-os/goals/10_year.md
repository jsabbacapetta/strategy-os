## Instructions

Your 10-year goals are not predictions. They're your North Star — the direction you're heading, not the exact coordinates.

10 years is long enough to:
- Build a category-defining company
- Completely change careers
- Transform your health and lifestyle
- Repair or rebuild relationships
- Achieve financial independence
- Create meaningful legacy

**Good 10-year goals are:**
- Directional, not tactical
- Inspiring enough to guide decisions today
- Flexible enough to adapt as you learn
- Meaningful enough to anchor you during hard times

**Update these goals:**
- Annually during your annual review
- When your life stage changes (marriage, kids, major health event, exit)
- When your values or priorities fundamentally shift

**Integrate with:**
- `goals/3_year.md` — your 3-year goals should align with this 10-year direction
- `frameworks/vivid_vision.md` — your 3-year vision should be a step toward your 10-year vision
- `interviews/future_self_interview.md` — your 10-year self should reflect this vision

## Common Pitfalls

**Too specific:** 10 years is too long to predict exact outcomes. Focus on direction, not details.

**Too vague:** "Be successful and happy" is not a 10-year goal. It's a platitude.

**Only business:** If your 10-year vision is only professional, you're designing a life of regret.

**Set and forget:** 10-year goals need annual check-ins to stay relevant.

**Someone else's vision:** Don't optimize for what sounds impressive. Optimize for what you actually want.

---

## Final Reminder

10-year goals are not constraints. They're a compass.

They help you say yes to the right opportunities and no to the wrong ones.

They help you endure hard years because you know where you're going.

They help you avoid the trap of optimizing for quarterly metrics at the expense of long-term direction.

**Your 10-year vision will change. That's fine. Update it when it does.**

**But always have a 10-year vision. Without it, you're just reacting.**

**The future is long. Design it intentionally.**
