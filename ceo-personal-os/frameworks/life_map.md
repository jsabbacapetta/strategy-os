# Life Map Framework

**Adapted from Alex Lieberman's Life Map**

A CEO who is winning at work but failing at health, relationships, or meaning is not winning. Success is a system, not a single metric.

The Life Map framework evaluates six critical domains of life and forces you to see the whole picture — where you're thriving, where you're coasting, and where you're quietly failing.

This is your regular systems check. Run it quarterly.

---

## The Six Domains

1. **Career** — your professional work, business, and impact
2. **Relationships** — partner, family, friendships, community
3. **Health** — physical fitness, sleep, nutrition, energy
4. **Meaning** — purpose, contribution, legacy, identity beyond work
5. **Finances** — income, savings, security, freedom
6. **Fun** — play, hobbies, travel, joy, experiences

**Key insight:** Neglecting one domain for too long will eventually break the others. You can't outwork a failing marriage. You can't out-earn chronic burnout. You can't out-strategize a lack of meaning.

---

## Instructions

For each domain, answer the prompts honestly. Then rate yourself on a scale of 1-10.

- **1-3:** Crisis or severe neglect
- **4-6:** Coasting or stagnant
- **7-8:** Thriving
- **9-10:** Exceptional (rare and hard to sustain)

**The goal is not to have all 10s.** That's impossible and exhausting. The goal is to have *intentional* scores — knowing where you're investing, where you're coasting, and where you're at risk.

## Part 2: The Overview

### Your Life Map Scores

| Domain        | Score (1-10) |
|---------------|--------------|
| Career        | _____        |
| Relationships | _____        |
| Health        | _____        |
| Meaning       | _____        |
| Finances      | _____        |
| Fun           | _____        |

**Average score:** _____ / 10

---

### Pattern Analysis

**Where are you thriving?** (7+ scores)

**Where are you coasting?** (4-6 scores)

**Where are you at risk?** (1-3 scores)

---

### Trade-Offs and Imbalance

Look at your scores. Are you massively over-indexed in one area at the expense of others?

**Example patterns:**
- Career 9, Relationships 3 → "I'm winning at work but my marriage is dying."
- Finances 9, Fun 2 → "I'm financially secure but joyless."
- Health 3, Career 8 → "I'm building a company but destroying my body."

**What trade-offs are you making right now?**

**Are these trade-offs intentional and temporary, or structural and unsustainable?**

---

## Part 3: Course Correction

### High-Leverage Moves

For each domain scoring below 6, what is *one* high-leverage action you could take in the next 30 days to improve it?

**Career:**

**Relationships:**

**Health:**

**Meaning:**

**Finances:**

**Fun:**

---

### The Integration Question

What's the one change that would improve *multiple* domains at once?

**Example:**
- "Hiring a COO would reduce my work hours (Career), give me time for my kids (Relationships), and let me start running again (Health)."
- "Moving to a smaller city would lower my cost of living (Finances), reduce stress (Health), and give me more time for hobbies (Fun)."

**Your integration move:**

### The Regret Check

If your current scores stayed exactly the same for the next 5 years, which domain would you regret most?

**Domain:**

**Why:**

**What does this tell you about your priorities?**

## Part 4: Quarterly Review Process

Run this Life Map assessment every quarter.

### Trend Analysis

Track your scores over time to spot patterns.

| Domain        | Q1  | Q2  | Q3  | Q4  |
|---------------|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| Career        |     |     |     |     |
| Relationships |     |     |     |     |
| Health        |     |     |     |     |
| Meaning       |     |     |     |     |
| Finances      |     |     |     |     |
| Fun           |     |     |     |     |

**What's improving consistently?**

**What's declining over time?**

**What's stuck?**

## Why This Framework Matters

Most founders optimize one domain (Career) and let the other five decay. They tell themselves "I'll fix it after the next funding round" or "Once we hit $10M ARR, I'll focus on health."

That day never comes. And even if it does, the damage is often irreversible.

The Life Map forces you to see the whole system and make intentional trade-offs instead of accidental ones.

**You can't win at life by only winning at work.**

---

## How to Use This Framework

- **Complete this assessment quarterly** (at the end of Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4)
- **Track trends over time** — are your scores improving, stable, or declining?
- **Reference it during weekly reviews** — did this week move you toward balance or away from it?
- **Use it as a decision filter** — when considering a new project, ask: "What domain does this serve, and what domain does it harm?"
