# Annual Review Framework

**Adapted from Dr. Anthony Gustin's Annual Review Process**

This framework is designed to help you extract signal from the past year and set clear intent for the next. It's not about judging yourself. It's about learning from what happened and deciding what happens next.

Run this process once per year, ideally in late December or early January. Block 3-4 hours of uninterrupted time. No laptop unless you're typing your answers. No distractions.

---

## Instructions

Answer each section honestly. Don't perform. Don't write what sounds impressive. Write what's true.

When finished, save your completed review in `reviews/annual/[YEAR].md` and update your goals in the `goals/` folder.

## Part 1: The Year in Review

### Peak Experiences

What were the 5-10 highest points of the year? Moments when you felt alive, energized, proud, or deeply satisfied.

These can be professional or personal. Big or small. What matters is that they mattered to you.

5.
6.

10.

**Pattern check:** What do these moments have in common? What conditions create peak experiences for you?

---

### Low Points

What were the 3-5 lowest points of the year? Moments of frustration, failure, disappointment, or depletion.

Be specific. Don't say "Q2 was rough." Say what actually happened and why it hurt.

**Pattern check:** What do these moments have in common? What conditions create valleys for you?

### Decisions You Made

What were the 3-5 most important decisions you made this year?

These might be:
- Strategic (pivoted the business, killed a product line, raised funding)
- Operational (hired a key person, fired someone, restructured the team)
- Personal (moved cities, ended a relationship, started therapy, set a new boundary)

1.

5.

**For each decision, ask:**
- Why did I make this choice?
- What was I optimizing for?
- Do I still agree with this decision six months later?

---

### Decisions You Avoided

What hard decisions did you delay, dodge, or rationalize away this year?

Examples:
- "I knew I needed to fire my VP of Sales in March, but I waited until October."
- "I should have said no to that partnership, but I was afraid of conflict."
- "I avoided the conversation with my co-founder about equity."

1.

3.

**Why does this matter:** Patterns of avoidance compound. If you've delayed the same decision for three years, it's no longer a decision — it's a policy.

## Part 2: Performance Analysis

### Wins (What Went Well)

What did you accomplish this year that you're genuinely proud of?

Include:
- Business outcomes (revenue, product launches, team growth)
- Personal outcomes (health, relationships, learning)
- Quiet wins that no one else sees

**Business:**
-
-
-

**Personal:**
-
-
-

**Quiet wins:**

### Failures (What Didn't Work)

What failed, flopped, or fell short this year?

Don't sanitize this. Real failures, not "I was too much of a perfectionist."

**Business:**
-
-
-

**Personal:**
-
-
-

**For each failure, ask:**
- Was this a good bet that didn't pay off, or a bad bet from the start?
- What did I learn?
- Would I make the same bet again?

---

### Energy Accounting

This is the most important section. Track your energy over the year.

**What energized you most this year?**
(Activities, people, projects, environments that left you feeling more alive)
-
-
-

**What drained you most this year?**
(Activities, people, projects, environments that left you depleted)
-
-
-

**Energy-to-output analysis:**

Look at your biggest accomplishments. How much energy did they require?
- High output, low energy cost = **leverage** (do more of this)
- High output, high energy cost = **expensive wins** (can you make this more sustainable?)
- Low output, high energy cost = **energy trap** (stop doing this)

**Leverage (high output, low energy):**
-
-

**Expensive wins (high output, high energy):**
-
-

**Energy traps (low output, high energy):**
-
-

## Part 3: Lessons and Themes

### Core Lessons

### Recurring Themes

Look back at past annual reviews, quarterly check-ins, or notes from previous years. What themes keep showing up?

**Repeated goals:**
(Goals you've set multiple years in a row but haven't achieved — why?)
-
-

**Repeated strengths:**
(Skills or qualities that show up every year — are you leveraging these?)
-
-

**Repeated drains:**
(Energy leaks or frustrations that keep appearing — can you eliminate these structurally?)
-
-

---

## Part 4: Forward Intent

### What You're Taking Into Next Year

Based on this review, what are you carrying forward?

- Practices that worked
- Relationships that matter
- Priorities that are still relevant
- Lessons that inform future decisions

**Carrying forward:**
-
-
-

---

### What You're Leaving Behind

What are you consciously choosing *not* to bring into next year?

- Projects that didn't work
- Relationships that drain you
- Habits that don't serve you
- Identities that no longer fit

**Leaving behind:**
-
-
-

### The One Thing

If you could only accomplish ONE thing next year — the thing that would make everything else easier or irrelevant — what would it be?

**The One Thing:**

## Part 5: Next Year Setup

After completing this review:

1. Update `north_star.md` with new context
2. Fill out `goals/1_year.md` with clear intent for next year
3. Refresh `frameworks/vivid_vision.md` with updated future vision
4. Recalculate `frameworks/ideal_life_costing.md` if your life design has changed
5. Update `frameworks/life_map.md` to assess balance across all six domains

## How This Framework Helps

Most people drift through years without extracting the lessons. They repeat the same mistakes, ignore the same patterns, and wonder why nothing changes.

This framework forces you to:
- **Acknowledge reality** (what actually happened, not what you wish happened)
- **Spot patterns** (recurring wins, failures, energy drains)
- **Learn systematically** (extract lessons, not just experiences)
- **Set clear intent** (what you're doing next year and why)

The difference between experience and growth is reflection.

This is your reflection.
