# Vivid Vision Framework

**Inspired by Tony Robbins-style future visualization**

Most goal-setting is abstract and lifeless. "Grow revenue by 30%" is a target, not a vision. A Vivid Vision is emotionally clear, sensorially rich, and intrinsically motivating. It's the future you can *feel*, not just the metrics you want to hit.

This framework helps you design a vision of your ideal life 3 years from now — not just your business, your *life* — that is specific enough to guide decisions today.

## Instructions

Answer these prompts as if you're living in the future, 3 years from now. Write in present tense. Be specific. Include sensory details. Don't write what sounds impressive. Write what would actually make you feel alive.

**Example of vague vision:** "I run a successful company."

**Example of vivid vision:** "It's Tuesday morning. I'm in my home office, overlooking the canyon. The company hit $20M ARR last quarter, but I only work four days a week now because I have a COO I trust completely. I just finished a two-hour deep work session on product strategy — my favorite part of the job. Tonight I'm cooking dinner with my partner, and we're not talking about work. This weekend we're hiking in Big Sur, and my phone will stay in the glove box the whole time."

See the difference? One is a metric. The other is a life.

## How to Use This Framework

- **Fill this out once per year** during your annual review
- **Reference it quarterly** when doing goal check-ins
- **Update it when your vision changes** (and it will — that's fine)
- **Use it as a decision filter** — when you're stuck on a choice, ask: "Which option moves me closer to this vision?"

---

## Why This Matters

You can hit every business goal and still feel empty if the life around the business is broken. A Vivid Vision forces you to design the whole system — work, health, relationships, meaning, fun — not just the revenue target.

The point isn't to predict the future. The point is to *design* it.

Most people are living someone else's vision of success. This framework helps you define your own.
