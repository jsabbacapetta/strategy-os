# Ideal Life Costing Framework

**Adapted from Tim Ferriss's Dreamline Exercise**

Most founders massively overestimate how much their ideal life costs. They grind for an exit they don't need, optimizing for a number that has no relationship to actual happiness or freedom.

This framework forces you to calculate: **What does the life you actually want cost per month?**

The answer is usually lower than you think. And that changes everything.

## Instructions

Be specific. Don't estimate. Look up actual costs. Use real numbers. The value of this exercise is in the precision, not the dreaming.

---

## Part 1: Define Your Ideal Lifestyle

Before you calculate cost, define what you're costing.

### Daily Life

Where do you want to live? (City, neighborhood, or country)

What kind of home? (Apartment, house, size, style)

What does a normal Tuesday look like in your ideal life?

---

### Work

How many hours per week are you working?

What kind of work are you doing?

Are you employed, self-employed, running a company, or retired?

---

### Travel and Experiences

How often do you want to travel per year?

Where do you want to go?

What kind of experiences do you want to have regularly? (Concerts, dinners, courses, events, etc.)

---

### Relationships and Social Life

What does your social life look like?

How often are you hosting, going out, or traveling with friends/family?

---

### Health and Wellness

What does your health routine look like?

Gym membership? Personal trainer? Nutritionist? Therapy?

---

### Fun and Hobbies

What are you doing for pure enjoyment?

Hobbies, classes, sports, creative pursuits?

---

## Part 2: Calculate Monthly Costs

Now let's put real numbers to this. Research actual costs in your target location.

### Housing

**Rent or mortgage:** $_______ /month

**Utilities (electricity, water, gas, internet):** $_______ /month

**Home maintenance/cleaning:** $_______ /month

**Total Housing:** $_______ /month

---

## Part 3: Total Monthly Cost

Add up all categories above.

**Total Monthly Cost of Ideal Life:** $_______ /month

**Total Annual Cost:** $_______ /year (monthly × 12)

---

## Part 4: Reality Check

### How does this compare to your current spending?

**Current monthly spending:** $_______ /month

**Ideal monthly spending:** $_______ /month

**Difference:** $_______ /month

---

### How does this compare to your income?

**Current monthly income (post-tax):** $_______ /month

**Ideal monthly cost:** $_______ /month

**Surplus/deficit:** $_______ /month

---

### What's the gap?

If there's a gap between your ideal life cost and your current income, how do you close it?

**Option 1: Reduce costs** — what can you cut or redesign?

**Option 2: Increase income** — what's the minimum income needed to sustain this lifestyle?

**Option 3: Redefine "ideal"** — is your vision actually what you want, or are you optimizing for someone else's dream?

---

## Part 5: The Mini-Retirement Test

Tim Ferriss's core insight: You don't need to retire at 65 with $10M. You can take mini-retirements throughout your life if you design your costs correctly.

### How much do you need to fund a 3-month mini-retirement?

**3 months of ideal lifestyle costs:** $_______ (monthly cost × 3)

**How long would it take you to save this at your current income?**

**Could you take a 3-month break every 2-3 years instead of grinding for 30 years straight?**

---

## Part 6: The Exit Number

If you're building a company, this is critical.

### What's your "enough" number?

If you exited your company, what amount of money (post-tax, in the bank) would allow you to sustain your ideal lifestyle indefinitely?

**Use the 4% rule:** Multiply your annual ideal cost by 25.

**Annual ideal cost:** $_______ /year

**× 25 = $_______ total needed**

(This assumes you can safely withdraw 4% per year from invested assets without running out.)

**Is this more or less than you expected?**

**Does this change your strategy?**

---

## Part 7: Reverse Engineering Your Life

Now that you know your number, what changes?

### Current Business Decisions

Are you raising more money than you need?

Are you optimizing for a $100M exit when a $10M exit would fully fund your ideal life?

Are you sacrificing years of your life for a goal that doesn't actually serve you?

---

### Current Lifestyle Decisions

Are you delaying your ideal life until some future milestone that keeps moving?

Could you design 80% of your ideal life *right now* by making different choices?

What would have to change?

---

### The Regret Minimization Check

You're 80 years old, looking back. Which scenario do you regret more?

**A)** Grinding for 10 years to hit a $50M exit, sacrificing health and relationships, then "retiring" exhausted.

**B)** Building a $5M business over 5 years, sustaining your ideal lifestyle along the way, and having energy left for the next chapter.

**There's no right answer. But there is *your* answer.**

## How to Use This Framework

- **Run this exercise once per year** during your annual review
- **Update it when your life stage changes** (marriage, kids, new city, new business stage)
- **Reference it when making big financial decisions** — raises, exits, investments, major purchases
- **Use it to fight lifestyle creep** — if your spending is growing faster than your happiness, something's wrong

---

## Why This Matters

Most people are optimizing for a financial goal they've never actually calculated. They just assume "more is better" and grind accordingly.

This framework gives you a specific target. And once you have a target, you can design a path to get there that doesn't destroy you in the process.

The goal isn't to live cheaply. The goal is to know your number so you can make intentional choices instead of default ones.

**Freedom isn't having infinite money. Freedom is knowing what enough looks like.**
