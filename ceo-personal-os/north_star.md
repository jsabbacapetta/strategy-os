# North Star

**This is your context. Fill this out once, update it quarterly, reference it constantly.**

The purpose of this file is to ground every decision, review, and reflection in your current reality. When you're doing a weekly review and asking "Does this matter?" — this file tells you what "matter" means right now.

---

## Current Priorities (Top 3)

These are the three things that, if you accomplished them this year, would make everything else easier or irrelevant. Not your to-do list. Your actual strategic priorities.

1. [PRIORITY 1 — e.g., "Reach $10M ARR," "Hire a world-class Head of Product," "Restore work-life boundaries"]
2. [PRIORITY 2]
3. [PRIORITY 3]

**When to update:** Quarterly, or when something fundamental shifts (funding, exit, personal crisis, strategic pivot).

## What Success Looks Like This Year

In December, if you look back at this year and feel genuinely satisfied, what will have happened?

[Write 3-5 sentences. Be specific. Include professional and personal outcomes. Example: "We hit $5M ARR with healthy unit economics. I took two real vacations without my laptop. I rebuilt trust with my co-founder after a rough Q2. I started running again."]

---

## What You're Trying to Avoid

Sometimes clarity comes from knowing what you *don't* want to repeat. What are you actively trying to avoid this year?

[Example: "Burning out my Head of Eng again. Saying yes to investors who don't align with our vision. Letting my health slide for six months straight."]

---

## Energy Sources (What Gives You Fuel)

What activities, people, or environments restore your energy? These are not indulgences — they're requirements.

- [e.g., "Long walks without my phone"]
- [e.g., "Deep work sessions on product strategy"]
- [e.g., "Dinner with my co-founder talking about the long game"]
- [e.g., "Teaching or mentoring younger founders"]

---

## Energy Drains (What Depletes You)

What consistently drains you? You can't eliminate all of these, but you can manage exposure.

- [e.g., "Back-to-back Zoom calls with no breaks"]
- [e.g., "Firefighting operational issues that should be delegated"]
- [e.g., "Fundraising conversations with investors who don't get it"]
- [e.g., "Late-night Slack spirals"]

---

## Non-Negotiables

What are the boundaries you will not cross, even under pressure? These are your rules for staying whole.

- [e.g., "No work emails after 8pm"]
- [e.g., "I don't take meetings before 9am"]
- [e.g., "I protect Saturdays for family"]
- [e.g., "I will not compromise on company values for growth"]

---

## Current Bets (What You're Testing)

What are you experimenting with right now? What hypotheses are you testing in your business or life?

[Example: "I'm testing whether a 4-day workweek for the team improves retention and output. I'm testing whether I can delegate all customer support escalations to my VP of Ops. I'm testing whether morning workouts actually improve my decision quality."]

---

## Key Relationships (Your Informal Board)

Who are the 3-5 people you turn to for perspective, challenge, or support? This is your informal personal board of directors.

1. [NAME — e.g., "Sarah (co-founder) — strategic thinking partner"]
2. [NAME — e.g., "James (former boss) — career advice and pattern recognition"]
3. [NAME — e.g., "Partner/Spouse — life priorities and reality checks"]
4. [NAME — optional]
5. [NAME — optional]

**Use this list:** When you're stuck on a decision, ask "Who on this list would have the most useful perspective?"

---

## What's Different This Year

What has changed since last year that affects how you operate or what you prioritize?

[Example: "We raised a Series A, so I'm now managing a board. My second kid was born, so my time is tighter. I hired a COO, so I can finally stop doing operations. My co-founder left, so I'm now solo CEO."]

---

## Guiding word of this year [WORD]

Choose a single word and make it your theme for the year. Not a sentence, not a paragraph, a single word that captures the kind of year you want and the kind of person you're trying to become. Maybe it's simplify or connect or build. Use this word as your compass for the rest of the year. When you're lost, remember that word and let it guide you. 

---
